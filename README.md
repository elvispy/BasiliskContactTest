# Bioreactor Simulation for Cultivated Meat Production

This repository contains a **two-phase flow simulation of a rocking bioreactor**, implemented in the [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/) open-source CFD platform. This collaborative work is conducted by the Radu Cimpeanu Scientific Computing Group at the University of Warwick and the Harris Lab at Brown University. The preprint of this work is available at https://arxiv.org/.

## üìå Features:
- ‚úÖ liquid-gas dynamics with embedded solid boundaries inside a rocking bioreactor
- ‚úÖ Tracer advection/diffusion for evaluating mixing efficiency
- ‚úÖ Oxygen transport, including advection, diffusion and gas-to-liquid interfacial transfer
- ‚úÖ Body acceleration in a non-inertial frame of reference, accounting for gravity, Coriolis, and centrifugal effects

## üõ†Ô∏è Installations

### 1. Requirements
- [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/) (compiled with `qcc`)
- C compiler
- Gnuplot / FFmpeg (for visualizing results)
```bash
sudo apt install gnuplot imagemagick ffmpeg graphviz valgrind gifsicle pstoedit
```

### 2. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rcsc-group/BioReactor
cd DriverCodes
```
### 3. Install the Basilisk
The code relies on Basilisk to solve the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations. Please refer to the installation page for setup instructions: http://basilisk.fr/src/INSTALL

### 4. Copy and paste the header files and compile the main code
- Copy the four header files (draw3.h, henry_oxy2.h, utils2.h, and view3.h) into the src folder of the Basilisk source directory.
- Run the shell script using: sh BioReactor.sh
- The shell script runs the executable file: ./Bioreactor L_bio ANGLE RPM
  - L_bio: Reference length scale in meters (e.g., 0.25)
  - ANGLE: Rocking angle in degrees (e.g., 7)
  - RPM: Rocking frequency in RPM (e.g., 32.5)
