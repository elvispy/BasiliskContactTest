# Bioreactor Simulation for Cultivated Meat Production using Basilisk

This repository contains a **two-phase flow simulation of a rocking bioreactor**, implemented in the [Basilisk](http://basilisk.fr/) open-source CFD platform.

## 📌 Features:
- ✅ liquid-gas motions with solid boundaries in a rocking bioreactor
- ✅ Tracer advection/diffusion for mixing evaluation
- ✅ Oxygen advection/diffusion and oxygen transfer from gas to liquid 
- ✅ Acceleration in a non-inertial frame of reference
- ✅ Surface tension and contact angles

## 🖼️ Visual Output

Generates:
- `*.mp4` videos (vorticity, tracer, oxygen)
- `*.png` figures
- `.txt` files of all field variables
- Interface geometry (VOF)
- Performance logs
